# This file contains regular expressions for methods that are enhanced in runtime by e.g., Guice or Spring Framework.
# Such method names must be un-decorated before recording an invocation or else the real declaring method in the code base will
# look unused.
#
# One pattern per line.
# Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.
# Syntax: see java.util.regex.Pattern.compile()
# Each pattern should have three groups: 1: the class name, 2: the method name and 3: the parameter list including parenthesis.
# Charset: UTF-8
#
# NOTE: The ordering in this file is important!
# The first matched pattern will be used.
