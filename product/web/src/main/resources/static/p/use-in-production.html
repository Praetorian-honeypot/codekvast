        <p>Your <em>real users use your software in your production environment</em>. Period.</p>

        <p>Therefore, you must collect usage data <em>where your real users use your software, i.e., in production!</em></p>

        <p>It is only in production you can get reliable data.</p>

        <p>Of course you can use Codekvast during training or test, but you will probably find less <a href="/page/truly-dead-code">truly

        <p>To get reliable results, <em>Codekvast should be running all the time, on all the servers in your server farm.</em></p>

        <p> If you break this rule, you will get misleading results, since individual servers in a cluster will have slightly different
            work-load.</p>

        <p>The results will be misleading in the sense that Codekvast might report perfectly healthy code as

        <h1>Extremely Low Overhead</h1>

        <p>The Codekvast Collector is extremely efficient. It adds roughly 30 nanoseconds to each tracked method call. </p>

        <p>The memory consumption is low. For a fairly large server application (0.5 million lines of code), the complete set of tracked
           method names occupy less than 10 MB of heap space.</p>

        <p>The collected data is written to a plain text file in the local file system at the end of each collection interval. This is also
           very efficient.</p>
