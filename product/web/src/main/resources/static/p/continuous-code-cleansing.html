        <h1>Continuous Code Cleansing</h1>

        <h2>A bit of history</h2>

        <p>Once upon a time, we developed software in a waterfall process.</p>

        <p>We wrote requirements specifications, functional specifications, design specifications, test specifications.</p>

        <p><em>Then</em> we started coding. We applied individual code ownership, and ended the development phase by trying to integrate all
                         the parts that had been developed in isolation by the different developers.</p>

        <p>This tended to be a nightmare to manage. No-one could tell how long the integration phase would take, and what problems might pop
           up.</p>

        <p><strong>So the developer community invented Continuous Integration, CI</strong>. Now we integrate early and often, problem
                                                                                          solved.</p>

        <p>With CI in place, the next thing to become a pain was delivery.</p>

        <p>Each time we tried to deploy our software to production was like a lottery. It was not uncommon that deployment of a new version
           could take days. Many times it failed, and we had to roll back to the previous version.</p>

        <p><strong>So the developer community invented Continuous Delivery, CD.</strong> Once again, problem solved.</p>

        <h2>And now what?</h2>

        <p>As lean and agile developers we are now quite good at delivering working software with sustainable velocity.</p>

        <p>Sprint after sprint we deliver new shiny features into production. <strong>It is not very common though that we <em>kill</em>
                                                                                      features!</strong></p>

        <p>We must soon start thinking about killing features. We must start doing <strong>Continuous Code Cleansing, CCC</strong>, the next
           logical step after CI and CD.</p>

        <p>Unless we continuously clean up after ourselves, our code base will inevitably grow into a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud" target="_blank">Big Ball Of Mud</a>, no matter our good intentions and
           high skill level.</p>
