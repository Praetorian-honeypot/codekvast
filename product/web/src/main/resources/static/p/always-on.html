        <p>To get reliable results, Codekvast should running all the time.</p>

        <p>Codekvast should also run on all servers in a clustered environment. Individual servers in a cluster will have slightly different
           work-load. If you run Codekvast on only one or a few servers in the cluster, you will get misleading results.</p>

        <p>Misleading in the sense that Codekvast Server might report perfectly healthy code as truly dead.</p>
