        <h1>Codekvast Should Be Always On</h1>

        <p>To get reliable results, <em>Codekvast should be running all the time, on all the servers in your server farm.</em></p>

        <p> If you break this rule, you will get misleading results, since individual servers in a cluster will have slightly different
            work-load.</p>

        <p>The results will be misleading in the sense that Codekvast might report perfectly healthy code as
            <a href="/page/truly-dead-code">truly dead</a>.</p>
