        <h1>Truly Dead Code</h1>

        <p>By Truly Dead Code we mean code that is <em>deployed in production, is available to users but has not been used for a certain
                                                       period of time</em>.</p>

        <p>Modern IDE:s like JetBrains IDEA can detect <em>statically</em> dead code, but will never suggest removal of any public methods.
           The IDE cannot know who the clients to the public code are.</p>

        <p>Statically dead code is code that the IDE can prove that no-one ever can invoke. The proof is done by analysing the source
           code.</p>

        <p>By collecting runtime invocation data, Codekvast kan help identify truly dead code <em>without access to the source code</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is Truly Dead Code harmful?</h2>

        <p>It is not harmful per se, since no-one is using it.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, it <em>is</em> harmful in a more subtle sense:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is most likely the oldest code that is truly dead. The oldest code was probably written by less experienced developers,
                and probably is more <a href="http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/" target="_blank"> STUPID</a>
                than <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/60845/The-S-O-L-I-D-Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP-Prin" target="_blank">SOLID</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Old code might contain undetected security vulnerabilities, since the code was written when the knowledge about e.g., <a
                    href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10"
                    target="_blank">OWASP Top 10</a> was not widespread.
            </li>
            <li>More code makes the code base harder to navigate and understand.</li>
            <li>More code slows down the development cycle. All code should be tested!</li>
            <li>Old code might hinder tool, libraries and framework upgrades. It is often the oldest code that use deprecated library
                features.
            </li>
        </ul>
