        <h1>Extremely Low Overhead</h1>

        <p>The Codekvast Collector is extremely efficient. It adds roughly 30 nanoseconds to each tracked method call.</p>

        <p>The memory consumption is low. For a fairly large server application (0.5 million lines of code), the complete set of tracked
           method names occupy less than 10 MB of heap space.</p>

        <p>The collected data is written to a plain text file in the local file system at the end of each collection interval. This is also
           very efficient.</p>
