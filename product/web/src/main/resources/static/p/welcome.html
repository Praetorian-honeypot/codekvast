        <h3>What is Codekvast?</h3>

        <p><strong>Codekvast identifies <a id="truly-dead-1" href="/page/truly-dead-code">Truly Dead Code</a> in your Java
                   applications.</strong></p>

        <p>Truly dead code is code that <strong>no real user has used in X days</strong>, where X is defined by you. For some applications,
           X could be a number of days. For other applications, X could be weeks, months or even years. Only you can tell what X is for your
           application. X is not a fixed value. Once Codekvast has been running for a while, you can experiment with different values of X.
        </p>

        <p>Use Codekvast <a id="in-production-1" href="/page/use-in-production">in production</a>. It is only there you can learn what parts
           of your code your <strong>real users</strong> are using and, more interestingly, <strong>not using</strong>.</p>

        <p>Codekvast works for <strong>Java and other JVM languages</strong> such as Groovy, Scala, Clojure, Jython and JRuby.</p>

        <p>Codekvast is designed to be <a id="always-on-1" href="/page/always-on">always on</a>.
           Codekvast will <a id="extremely-low-1" href="/page/extremely-low-overhead">not disturb the normal operation of your
                                                                                      application</a>, and it requires very little
           administration.</p>

            <li>
                <strong>Codekvast Agent</strong> combines the invocation data with an automatically generated inventory of your installed

                <strong>Codekvast Agent</strong> periodically uploads invocation data plus the code inventory to the cloud-hosted Codekvast

                <strong>Codekvast Server</strong> has a real-time web interface for visualizing the captured data. This is where you play
