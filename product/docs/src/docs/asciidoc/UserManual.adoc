Codekvast User Manual covers installation and usage of Codekvast, a tool for detecting Truly Dead Code in JVM-based applications.

== Overview

Codekvast is a tool for detecting <<truly-dead-code, Truly Dead Code>>, that is, code that is in production but not used by any real users
for a <<usage-cycle, usage cycle>>.

Codekvast works for Java and other languages that execute in a JVM.

=== Architecture
Codekvast consists of three parts: the *Collector*, the *Agent* and the *Server*.

.Responsibilities
Codekvast Collector:: The collector is attached to the JVM that runs your application. It records the invocations of the methods of
interest. At the end of each recording interval, the *invocation data* is written to a text file, and a new recording interval is started.
There is exactly one collector per JVM. The collector uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AspectJ[AspectJ, role="external", window="_new"]
for hooking into
your
application.

Codekvast Agent:: Analyses the application's <<application-binaries, binaries>> to produce an *inventory* of the application. The inventory
consists
of all the method signatures that the collector potentially can record. The agent combines the method inventory with the invocation data
 from the collector(s) and uploads it to the server. There is one agent per server host. One agent can collect invocation data from
 several JVMs that are executing in the same host.

Codekvast Server:: Receives inventory and invocation data from the agent(s), stores it in a database and makes it available for browsing
in a web
interface. There is only one server.
