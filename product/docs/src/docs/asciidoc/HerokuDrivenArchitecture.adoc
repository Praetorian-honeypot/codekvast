[Abstract]

Heroku drives architectural change to Codekvast as it is a cloud service. Here we will document
our findings.

== What may be problems

We suspect that the current architecture, designed for a very different scenario, may cause problems
for an app in Heroku.

The repository codekvast-sample-heroku contains an example we use to investigate where a Heroku app
stumbles.

=== List methods

Currently, there is a daemon running on the same host as the application that in runtime loads classes
from binaries to find all methods of all classes. That list is compared with the list of methods
invoked.

We suspect that it will be hard to set up where the binaries are to be find. While perhaps possible, the
user experience might still suffer.

=== Running a daemon

Heroku has support for background jobs so that running a daemon might be possible but would require
some configuration by the user.

=== Storing data in files

Heroku allows you to use the file system for temporary files. You risk loosing data, especially when
deploying new version. There is some restarting going one every 24 hours as well, which might cause
problems.
