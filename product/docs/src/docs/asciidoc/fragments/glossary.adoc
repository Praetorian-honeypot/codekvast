[[truly-dead-code]]
Truly Dead Code:: By Truly Dead Code we mean code that is _deployed in production, is available to users but has not been used for a certain
                                                       period of time_ (a <<usage-cycle, usage cycle>>).
+
Modern IDE:s like JetBrains IDEA can detect _statically_ dead code, but will never suggest removal of any public methods.
 The IDE cannot know who the clients to the public code are.
+
Statically dead code is code that the IDE can prove that no-one ever can invoke. The proof is done by analysing the source
   code.
+
By collecting runtime invocation data, Codekvast kan help identify truly dead code _without access to the source code_.
+
_Why is Truly Dead Code harmful?_
+
It is not harmful per se, since no-one is using it.
+
Nevertheless, it _is_ harmful in a more subtle sense:
+

* It is most likely the oldest code that is truly dead. The oldest code was probably written by less experienced developers,
    and probably is more http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code[STUPID, role="external", window="_blank"]
    than http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/60845/The-S-O-L-I-D-Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP-Prin[SOLID, role="external", window="_blank"].

* Old code might contain undetected security vulnerabilities, since the code was written when the knowledge about e.g.,
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10[OWASP Top 10, role="external", window="_blank"] was not widespread.

* More code makes the code base harder to navigate and understand.
* More code slows down the development cycle. All code should be tested!
* Old code might hinder tool, libraries and framework upgrades. It is often the oldest code that use deprecated library
    features.

[[usage-cycle]]
Usage Cycle:: The period of time after one can assume that all features of an application has been used.
+
For some applications, the usage cycle could be a number of days.
+
For other applications, the usage cycle could be weeks, months or even years.
+
Only you can tell what the usage cycle is for your application. Usage cycle is not a fixed value. Once Codekvast has been running for a
while, you can experiment with different values of usage cycle.
+
Different applications that are parts of the same solution probably have different usage cycles. Example: front-end web, mobile API,
back-office web, data warehouse.

[[application-binaries]]
Application Binaries:: The WAR file, EAR file or set of JAR files that make up your application. Codekvast Agent needs these in order to
make an inventory of the available methods in your application.
