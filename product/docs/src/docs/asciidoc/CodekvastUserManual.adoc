Codekvast User Manual covers installation and usage of Codekvast, a tool for detecting Truly Dead Code in JVM-based applications.

== Overview

Codekvast is a tool for detecting <<truly-dead-code, Truly Dead Code>>. By that we mean code that is in <<use-in-production,
production>> but not used by any real users for a <<usage-cycle, usage cycle>>.

Codekvast works for Java and other languages that execute in a JVM.

=== Architecture
Codekvast consists of three parts: the *Collector*, the *Agent* and the *Server*.

.Responsibilities
Codekvast Collector:: The collector is attached to the JVM that runs your application. It records the invocations of the methods of
interest. At the end of each recording interval, the <<invocation-data, invocation data>> is written to a text file, and a new recording
interval is started.
There is exactly one collector per JVM. The collector uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AspectJ[AspectJ, role="external", window="_new"]
for hooking into your application. *The collector requires Java 6 or higher.*

Codekvast Agent:: Analyses the application's <<application-binaries, binaries>> to produce an <<method-inventory, inventory>> of the
application. The
inventory consists of all the method signatures that the collector potentially can record. The agent combines the method inventory with the invocation data
 from the collector(s) and uploads it to the server. There is one agent per server host. One agent can collect invocation data from
 several JVMs that are executing in the same host. *The agent requires Java 6 or higher.*

Codekvast Server:: Receives inventory and invocation data from the agent(s), stores it in a database and makes it available for browsing
in a web
interface. There is only one server. *The server requires Java 7 or higher.*

== Installation
=== Install Codekvast Agent

The Codekvast agent must be installed in each host that runs an application that shall be tracked by Codekvast.

Execute the following commands in a shell:

[source,bash,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
wget {bintrayDownloadPrefix}/codekvast-agent-{codekvast-version}.zip
sudo unzip codekvast-agent-{codekvast-version}.zip -d /opt
cd /opt
sudo ln -s codekvast-agent-{codekvast-version} codekvast-agent
cd /opt/codekvast-agent/conf
sudo cp codekvast-agent.properties.sample.{codekvast-version} codekvast-agent.properties # <1>
sudo ln -s /opt/codekvast-agent/etc/init.d/codekvast-agent /etc/init.d
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/codekvast
sudo chkconfig --add /etc/init.d/codekvast-agent # <2>
----
<1> Edit codekvast-agent.properties to suit your needs. See <<configuring-codekvast-agent, Configuring Codekvast Agent>>.
<2> This works for Redhat-based Linux distros. For Debian-based distros, use `sudo update-rc.d codekvast-agent defaults` instead.

Once you have finished editing codekvast-agent.properties, execute

----
sudo /etc/init.d/codekvast-agent start
----

=== Modify all applications' start scripts

[[install-collector-tomcat-linux]]
==== Tomcat (Linux)

[source,bash,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
cd path/to/tomcat # <1>
cp /opt/codekvast-agent/conf/codekvast-collector.conf.sample.{codekvast-version} conf/codekvast.conf # <2>
cp /opt/codekvast-agent/bin/tomcat/setenv.sh bin/
----
<1> Substitute `path/to` with the actual path were Tomcat is installed.
<2> Edit `conf/codekvast.conf` to suit your needs. See <<configuring-codekvast-collector, Configuring Codekvast Collector>>.

==== Tomcat (Windows)

[source,cmd,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
set CODEKVAST_HOME="path\to\codekvast-agent-{codekvast-version}" # <1>
cd path\to\tomcat # <2>
mkdir endorsed
copy %CODEKVAST_HOME%\javaagents\* endorsed
copy %CODEKVAST_HOME%\bin\tomcat\setenv.bat bin # <3>
copy %CODEKVAST_HOME%\conf\codekvast-collector.conf.sample.{codekvast-version} conf\codekvast.conf # <4>
----
<1> Ssubstitute `path\to` with the actual path were Codekvast is installed.
<2> Substitute `path\to` with the actual path were Tomcat is installed.
<3> Edit `bin\setenv.bat` so that CODEKVAST_HOME matches the path were codekvast-agent-{codekvast-version} is installed.
<4> Edit `conf\codekvast.conf` to suit your needs. See <<configuring-codekvast-collector, Configuring Codekvast Collector>>.

==== Other applications

Use <<install-collector-tomcat-linux, the installation guide for Tomcat>> as a basis.

The goal is to make

`-javaagent:/path/to/codekvast-collector-{codekvast-version}.jar -javaagent:/path/to/aspectjweaver-{aspectj-version}.jar`

appear as the first arguments to the `java` command and `codekvast-collector.conf` or `codekvast.conf` appear in any of the locations that
Codekvast Collector expects it. See <<codekvast-collector-config-file-location, Configuring Codekvast Collector>>.

[TIP]
====
There is a helper script called `/opt/codekvast-agent/bin/showJvmParams.sh` that when invoked produces a valid JVM_OPTS that can be pasted
into your
application's start script.
====

==== Trouble shooting

If you get `LinkageError` on some aspectj-related type::
. Move `aspectjweaver-{aspectj-version}.jar` to a separate directory (called `/path/to/endorsed` below).
. Add `-Djava.endorsed.dir=/path/to/endorsed/` to the `java` command.

No data in /tmp/codekvast::
. `export CODEKVAST_OPTIONS=verbose=true`
. set `aspectjOptions=-verbose -showWeaveInfo` in codekvast-collector.conf
. restart your application
. Use the logging on standard output and standard error for determining the problem

=== Install Codekvast Server

. Make sure Java 7 or higher is installed.
. Download https://bintray.com/artifact/download/crisp/foobar/agent/foobar-server-{codekvast-version}.zip[codekvast-server.zip] to any directory
. Execute the following commands in a shell:

[source,bash,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
wget {bintrayDownloadPrefix}/codekvast-server-{codekvast-version}.zip
sudo unzip codekvast-server-{codekvast-version}.zip -d /opt
cd /opt
sudo ln -s codekvast-server-{codekvast-version} codekvast-server
cd /opt/codekvast-server/conf
sudo cp codekvast-server.properties.sample.{codekvast-version} codekvast-server.properties # <1>
sudo ln -s /opt/codekvast-server/etc/init.d/codekvast-server /etc/init.d
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/codekvast
sudo mkdir -p /var/backups/codekvast
sudo chkconfig --add /etc/init.d/codekvast-server # <2>
----
<1> Edit codekvast-server.properties to suit your needs. See <<configuring-codekvast-server, Configuring Codekvast Server>>.
<2> This works for Redhad-based Linux distros. For Debian-based distros, use `sudo update-rc.d codekvast-server defaults` instead.

Once you have finished editing codekvast-server.properties, execute

----
sudo /etc/init.d/codekvast-server start
----

== Configuration

[[configuring-codekvast-collector]]
=== Codekvast Collector

[[codekvast-collector-config-file-location]]
==== Configuration File Name and Location

The collector reads it's configuration from a file named either `codekvast-collector.conf` or `codekvast.conf` in any of these places (the
first
found file will win:)

. The Java system property `-Dcodekvast.configuration=path/to/configfile`.
. The environment variable `CODEKVAST_CONFIG=path/to/configfile`.
. The file `${codekvast.home}/conf/codekvast-collector.conf` or `${codekvast.home}/conf/codekvast.conf` (codekvast.home is a
Java system property)
. The file `${CODEKVAST_HOME}/conf/codekvast-collector.conf` or `${CODEKVAST_HOME}/conf/codekvast.conf` (CODEKVAST_HOME is an
environment variable)
. In a similar way it looks for
.. catalina.home
.. CATALINA_HOME
.. catalina.base
.. CATALINA_BASE
. It looks for the configuration file in the `conf/` sibling directory to where codekvast-collector-{codekvast-version}.jar is located.
. It looks for the configuration file in `/etc/codekvast`.
. It looks for the configuration file in `/etc`.

[TIP]
====
To aid in troubleshooting configuration file location problems one can do `export CODEKVAST_VERBOSE=true` before starting the application.

This is handy since it can be done without editing any start scripts.
====

==== Config file override mechanism
It is possible to override one or more parameters that were specified in the configuration file by defining the Java system property
`codekvast.options`. The value should be a semicolon-separated list of name=value pairs.

.Example
----
-Dcodekvast.options=appName=myApp;collectorIntervalSeconds=600
----

The override mechanism comes in handy when you have more than one app in the same host, with mostly identical configuration. Probably
just the application name is different.

==== Codekvast Collector configuration file

The format of the file is a standard Java Properties file, that is, `key: value` or `key = value`. Long lines can be continued by ending the
line with a backslash ('\') and indenting the continuation line with at least one space.

The right-hand side may contain references to environment variables and Java system properties. Example:
....
dataDir = ${user.home}/codekvast
dataDir = $HOME/codekvast
....

[[about-specifying-code-base]]
==== About specifying codeBase
For a WAR (e.g., jenkins.war) deployed in Tomcat, specify `/path/to/apache-tomcat-x.x.x/webapps/jenkins`
without the .war suffix. Tomcat will automatically explode the war into a folder without the .war suffix.

Some applications (e.g., Jenkins) will download plugins on the fly and store them in some well-known location on disk.
In the case of Jenkins this path is `${user.home}/.jenkins/plugins`.

Spaces in a path must be escaped, i.e., preceded with a baskslash ('\') character.

When running on Windows, the colon after the drive letter must be escaped, i.e., preceded with a backslash '\'.

[[app-version-strategy]]
==== About specifying appVersion
Codekvast has some strategies for automatically finding the deployed application's version:

.Application version strategies
[cols="1,4,9,1"]
|===
|Strategy |Description |Examples |Result

|*manifest*
|Locates a certain jar file within the codeBase with a well-known name and extracts the version from the jar file's META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
|appVersion = manifest myapp.jar +
appVersion = manifest myapp.jar Implementation-Version +
appVersion = manifest myapp.jar My-Custom-Version-Attribute +

Example 1 and 2 yields the same result.
| The value of the manifest attribute

|*filename*
|Locates a jar file within the codeBase with a name that matches a regular expression and extracts the version within the parenthesis from
the file name.
|`appVersion = filename myapp-(.*).jar`
|The part within parenthesis.

|*literal*
|The value in the configuration file is used as-is.
|`literal 3.14`
|3.14

[[about-clobberAopXml]]
==== About clobberAopXml
Normally, codekvast-collector uses the information in codekvast-collector.conf for producing a tailored aop.xml that then is fed to
aspectjweaver. This is done every time the instrumented application starts.

If you have special needs, you can disable this behaviour by setting `clobberAopXml = false`.

This gives you a chance to fine-tune how the AspectJ weaver shall work. You can for instance exclude certain performance-critical packages
from weaving.

See also {aspectj-ltw-configuration}.

[WARNING]
====
Excluding packages from AspectJ weaving will give misleading results! Excluded code that is perfectly healthy will be reported as Truly
Dead.

Use at your own risk.

[[configuring-codekvast-agent]]
=== Codekvast Agent
The agent reads it configuration from /opt/codekvast-agent/conf/codekvast-agent.properties.

The sample configuration file /opt/codekvast-agent/conf/codekvast-agent.properties.sample.{codekvast-version} is self
documenting.

[[configuring-codekvast-server]]
=== Codekvast Server
The server reads it configuration from /opt/codekvast-server/conf/codekvast-server.properties.

The sample configuration file /opt/codekvast-server/conf/codekvast-server.properties.sample.{codekvast-version} is self
documenting.

== Usage hints
[[use-in-production]]
Use Codekvast In Production:: Your _real users use your software in your production environment_. Period.
+
Therefore, you must collect usage data _where your real users use your software, i.e., in production!_
+
It is only in production you can get reliable data.
+
Of course you can use Codekvast during training or test, but you will probably find less <<truly-dead-code, truly dead code>>
than if you use Codekvast in production!
+
[NOTE]
====
The Codekvast Collector is extremely efficient. It adds roughly 30 nanoseconds to each tracked method call.

The memory consumption is low. For a fairly large server application (0.5 million lines of code), the complete set of tracked
method names occupy less than 10 MB of heap space.

The collected data is written to a plain text file in the local file system at the end of each collection interval. This is also
very efficient.
====

[[always-on]]
Codekvast Should Be Always On:: To get reliable results, _Codekvast should be running all the time, on all the servers in your server farm._
+
If you break this rule, you will get misleading results, since individual servers in a cluster will have slightly different
work-load.
+
The results will be misleading in the sense that Codekvast might report perfectly healthy code as <<truly-dead-code,truly dead>>.

== Glossary

[[truly-dead-code]]
Truly Dead Code:: By Truly Dead Code we mean code that is _deployed in production, is available to users but has not been used for a certain
period of time_ (a <<usage-cycle, usage cycle>>).
+
Modern IDE:s like JetBrains IDEA can detect _statically_ dead code, but will never suggest removal of any public methods.
 The IDE cannot know who the clients to the public code are.
+
Statically dead code is code that the IDE can prove that no-one ever can invoke. The proof is done by analysing the source
   code.
+
By collecting runtime invocation data, Codekvast kan help identify truly dead code _without access to the source code_.
+
_Why is Truly Dead Code harmful?_
+
It is not harmful per se, since no-one is using it.
+
Nevertheless, it _is_ harmful in a more subtle sense:
+

* It is most likely the oldest code that is truly dead. The oldest code was probably written by less experienced developers,
    and probably is more http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code[STUPID, role="external", window="_blank"]
    than http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/60845/The-S-O-L-I-D-Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP-Prin[SOLID, role="external", window="_blank"].

* Old code might contain undetected security vulnerabilities, since the code was written when the knowledge about e.g.,
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10[OWASP Top 10, role="external", window="_blank"] was not widespread.

* More code makes the code base harder to navigate and understand.
* More code slows down the development cycle. All code should be tested!
* Old code might hinder tool, libraries and framework upgrades. It is often the oldest code that use deprecated library
    features.

[[usage-cycle]]
Usage Cycle:: The period of time after one can assume that all features of an application has been used.
+
For some applications, the usage cycle could be a number of days.
+
For other applications, the usage cycle could be weeks, months or even years.
+
Only you can tell what the usage cycle is for your application. Usage cycle is not a fixed value. Once Codekvast has been running for a
while, you can experiment with different values of usage cycle.
+
Different applications that are parts of the same solution probably have different usage cycles. Example: front-end web, mobile API,
back-office web, data warehouse.

[[invocation-data]]
Invocation Data:: The set of methods that have been invoked during a collection interval. It contains the fully qualified names of the
methods and the fully qualified types of the methods' parameters.

[[application-binaries]]
Application Binaries::
The WAR file, EAR file or set of JAR files that make up your application. Codekvast Agent needs these in order to
make an inventory of the available methods in your application.

[[method-inventory]]
Method Inventory:: All methods which belong to any of the packages of interest.
