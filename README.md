# README for Codekvast

## Directory structure

The product itself lives under `product/`.

Sample projects to use when testing Codekvast lives under `sample/`.

Development tools live under `tools/`.

## Development environment

### JDK

Java 8 **and** Java 6 is required. OpenJDK is recommended.

### Database

MariaDB v10.0 or later is **required** for Codekvast **Warehouse**.

Use the following command to install MariaDB (Ubuntu, Debian):

    sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
    
Then the following commands must be executed once:
    
    $ sudo mysql
    create database codekvast_warehouse;
    grant all on codekvast_warehouse.* to 'codekvast'@'localhost' identified by 'codekvast';
    Ctrl-D
    
### Build tool

Codekvast uses **Gradle** as build tool. It uses the Gradle Wrapper, `gradlew`, which is checked in at the root of the workspace.
There is the convenience script `tools/src/script/gradle` which simplifies invocation of gradlew. Install that script in your PATH
and use that script instead of `path/to/gradlew`

### Software publishing
Codekvast is published to Bintray. To be able to upload to Bintray you need the following lines in your `~/.gradle/gradle
.properties`:

    bintrayUser=my-bintray-user
    bintrayKey=my-bintray-key

You also need to be member of the Crisp organisation in Bintray.

### IDE

**Intellij Ultimate Edition 14+** is the recommended IDE with the following plugins:

1. **Lombok Support** (required)
1. **Git** (required)
1. Github (optional)
1. AspectJ Support (optional)
1. AngularJS (optional)
1. Karma (optional)

## How to build the product
    cd <root>/product
    ../gradlew build

Or if using the convenience gradle script:

    cd <root>/product
    gradle build

The rest of this README assumes you use the convenience script.

## How to test with Tomcat+Jenkins

### Start Jenkins 1 in terminal 1

    gradle :sample:jenkins1:run

This will download Tomcat 7 and then download and deploy one version of Jenkins into Tomcat. Finally, Tomcat is started on port 8081 with 
Codekvast Collector attached.
Terminate with `Ctrl-C`.

You can access Jenkins at [http://localhost:8081/jenkins](http://localhost:8081/jenkins)

### Start Jenkins 2 in terminal 2

    gradle :sample:jenkins2:run

This will download Tomcat 7 and then download and deploy another version of Jenkins into Tomcat. Finally, Tomcat is started on port 8082 
with 
Codekvast Collector attached.
Terminate with `Ctrl-C`.

You can access Jenkins at [http://localhost:8082/jenkins](http://localhost:8082/jenkins)

### Start Codekvast daemon in terminal 3

    gradle :product:agent:daemon:run

This will launch the Codekvast **daemon**, that will process output from the collectors attached to the two Jenkins instances.
The daemon will regularly produce data files in /tmp/codekvast/.export.
Terminate the daemon with `Ctrl-C`.

### Start Codekvast Warehouse in terminal 4

    gradle :product:warehouse:run

This will start Codekvast Warehouse. It will look for the data files produced by codekvast-daemon and import them to the
local MariaDB database **codekvast_warehouse** (username/password: `codekvast/codekvast`).
Terminate with `Ctrl-C`.

Log in to MariaDB with `mysql -ucodekvast -pcodekvast codekvast_warehouse`.

Examine the collected data by means of `SELECT * FROM MethodInvocations1`
